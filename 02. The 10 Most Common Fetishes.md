In my 15 years on the phone, I've heard more fetishes than I can count. From the classics we all know to things so specific even Google doesn't know them. And you know what? None have surprised me. Because at the end of the day, the human brain is wonderfully creative when it comes to pleasure.

My name is Raquel Rivera, and as a psychosexual therapist, I can tell you something important: having a fetish doesn't make you weird, sick, or abnormal. It makes you human. What does matter is how you explore it—with consent, safety, and without harming anyone.

So let's talk about the 10 most common fetishes I encounter in my calls. Not as a cold medical manual, but as a conversation between adults. Because understanding your fetish is the first step to fully enjoying it.

## 1. Foot Fetish (Podophilia)

Let's start with the classic. Feet are the most common fetish that exists—studies suggest up to 47% of people with fetishes have some interest in feet.

Why? There are theories. Some say it's because the brain area that processes feet is near the genital area. Others believe it comes from early experiences. The truth? It doesn't matter much why. What matters is that it's incredibly common.

**How to explore it:** From elegant feet photos to massages, pedicures, or even incorporating it into sexual play. The important thing is finding someone who understands and enjoys your interest. Me, personally? I love when a caller appreciates my feet. There's something so intimate about it, so specific and personal.

## 2. Lingerie Fetish

Stockings, corsets, stilettos—there's something about lingerie that completely transforms the sexual experience. It's not just seeing; it's the anticipation, the reveal, the art of seduction.

Many of my callers have specific preferences: black lace, red silk, fishnet stockings. And I love playing with that. "You know what I'm wearing today, papi?" It's simple but effective.

**How to explore it:** Lingerie is easy to incorporate into any relationship. It's visual, it's tactile, and can be as elegant or daring as you want. In phone sex, we describe it in luxurious detail—the sound of stockings rubbing together, the smell of leather, the feel of lace.

## 3. Domination and Submission Fetish (BDSM)

This is broad and complex. It ranges from light power play to structured D/s relationships. What many don't understand is that BDSM isn't just about pain—it's about trust, surrender, and releasing control.

My callers who enjoy BDSM are usually two types: those who control everything all day and need to release control, or those who have no control in their lives and need to feel powerful.

**How to explore it:** Start soft. A little dominant dirty talk, specific instructions, light restraints. Constant communication is key. In phone sex, I can guide you through complete D/s scenarios, establishing clear boundaries before we begin.

## 4. Voice Fetish (Vocalism)

This is my favorite, obviously. There are people who simply get aroused by certain types of voices: accents, tones, ways of speaking. A whisper can be more powerful than any image.

As a Latina, my accent is part of my appeal. The Spanish interspersed, the Spanglish words, the Caribbean rhythm of my voice—all of that creates a unique experience.

**How to explore it:** Experiment with different voices, accents, languages. Record your own sexy audios. In phone sex, the voice IS the medium—every sigh, every moan, every "ay, papi" is part of the game.

## 5. Roleplay Fetish

Doctors and patients, teachers and students, strangers at a bar—roleplay allows you to explore forbidden dynamics safely. It's the fantasy of the taboo without the real consequences.

**How to explore it:** Start with simple scenarios. The key is commitment to the character and clear boundaries. In phone sex, we can create incredibly detailed worlds where anything is possible.

## 6. Voyeurism and Exhibitionism

Watching or being watched. In the digital age, this has evolved into sexting, video calls, and online exhibitionism. But the psychological core remains the same: the thrill of seeing or being seen.

**How to explore it:** Phone sex offers a safe middle ground—you can be exhibitionist without physical exposure. I describe what I would show you, what you would see, creating the illusion perfectly.

## 7. Object Fetishism

Shoes, leather, latex, silk—some people are specifically attracted to materials or objects. The texture, the smell, the visual of certain items creates arousal.

**How to explore it:** Incorporate these objects into your fantasies. Describe them in detail during calls. In phone sex, words are our props—we paint pictures with descriptions.

## 8. Age Play

This involves roleplaying different ages, usually within a dominant/submissive dynamic. It's important to note this is purely fantasy between consenting adults.

**How to explore it:** Clear boundaries and aftercare are essential. In phone sex, we can explore these dynamics verbally while maintaining clear separation from reality.

## 9. Fetish for Specific Body Parts

Beyond feet—hands, hair, necks, bellies. The human body is full of erogenous zones, and some people have very specific preferences.

**How to explore it:** Focus on those parts during fantasy and description. As a phone sex operator, I'm an expert at highlighting whatever body part excites you most.

## 10. Fantasy of Being "Used" or "Worshipped"

At opposite ends of the spectrum—some want to feel completely at someone's mercy, others want to be adored like a deity. Both are about extreme emotional states.

**How to explore it:** These require deep trust and clear communication. In phone sex, we can explore both extremes safely, switching between them as desired.

## Final Thoughts

Whatever your fetish, remember: you're not alone. Whatever excites you, someone else shares that interest. The key is finding safe, consensual ways to explore it.
